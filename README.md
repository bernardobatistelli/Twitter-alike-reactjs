# Tombattwitter

This project is inspired in the Rocketseat - Ignite React course. It is designed in react, using diverse libs in order to make the code more performant and efficient.
It is a simple project, it doesn´t have any structure to save data but I´m getting used to this technology.

The main idea behind the name "Tombatwitter" is that this website is kind of a Twitter, but designed for Tombattondu (my soccer team) players.
